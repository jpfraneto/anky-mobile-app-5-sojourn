# Welcome to the mobile app of Anky.

you don't need any .env, all of the code of the app is self contained (at least for now)

i like running it on my iphone. i do that with the command

```
npx expo run:ios --device
```

and then choose my phone from the list. but you can also run it on the simulator with

```
npx expo start
```

don't forget to run `npm install` first
